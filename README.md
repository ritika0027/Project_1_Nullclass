# Data Visualization & Analysis Internship  

##  Project Overview  
This project was completed during my **Data Analyst Internship at NULLCLASS**. The goal was to analyze job market data and create **interactive Tableau dashboards** with **Python-based preprocessing**.  

##  Key Features  
- **Tableau Dashboards**: Visualizing job roles, company sizes, and demographics.  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and formatted datasets using **Pandas & NumPy**.  
- **Time Zone Adjustments**: Converted timestamps to **IST** in Tableau.  
- **Deployment**: Explored **Netlify/Vercel** for hosting reports.  

## Tech Stack  
- **Tableau** (Dashboards & Visualizations)  
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy)** (Data Cleaning)  
- **Git & GitHub** (Version Control)  
- **Netlify/Vercel** (Deployment)  

## Tasks assigned
- **Draw a chart for top 5 roles in 2023 and work type=’Intern’ and Job Title should be Account Director and company should be below 2M.**

The job posting date should be between 01/01/2023 to 06/01/2023. The qualification should be B.Tech and we should ignore other qualifications. This graph should work only between 3PM IST to 5 PM IST apart from that time we should not show this graph in dashboard itself.**

- **Draw a chart between company size and company name where company size<50000 and job title should be mechanical engineer and experience should be more than 5 years and country should be Asian as well as salary should be more than $50k and the work type should be both part time and full time and ignore all other work types and the preference should be male .we should filter candidates those who are applied on idealist and this graph should work only between 3PM IST to 5 PM IST apart from that time we should not show this graph in dashboard itself.**
